## My technical background:
The programming languages I know are C and Python; I am also familiar and comfortable with Linux commands. My favorite 
programming project was my chess program 
I wrote in Python. This project is one where I used various object oriented programming principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. I 
used these to make a cleaner, and better chess program than in comparison to if I didn't use these principles. This chess project is my favorite as it 
pushed me to learn more, and to think critically about what the code I am writing actually does.

I also have work experience at Geek Squad Best Buy. I've worked there since June 2023 and am still currently employed there. Here I helped diagnose and 
trouble shoot clinets PCs and phones. More than that though, I learned a 
lot about what it means to be apart of a team. Everyone has different levels of experience, knowledge, and comfort with certain devices, and as a 
result a big part of the job was playing to everyones strengths and what everyone felt confident in troubleshooting/diagnosing.
