## My technical background:
When it comes to programming I know C and Python; I have also have worked with UNIX systems before. My favorite programming project was my chess program 
I wrote in Python. This project is one where I used various object oriented programming principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. I 
used these to make a cleaner, and better chess program than in comparison to if I didn't use these principles. This chess project is my favorite as it 
pushed me to learn more, and to think critically about what the code I am writing actually does.

I also have work experience at Geek Squad Best Buy. Here I helped diagnose and trouble shoot clinets PCs and phones. More than that though, I learned a 
lot about what it means to be apart of a team. Everyone has a different level of experience, knowledge, and comfort with various devices, and as a 
result a big part of the job was playing to everyones strengths and what everyone felt confident in troubleshooting/diagnosing.
